    <title>Sweet Little Human</title>
    <link>https://r8dio.dk/program/sweet-little-human</link>
    <description>Poor Mother Nature. It's been a tough few thousand years. Tired and traumatized by relentless human expansion, they battle many of the ills that plague humans today: Addiction, anxiety, depression. And, of course, pure, cynical, unpredictable rage.

Their only solace? A good glass of whisky with their clumsy friend Mr.Bee.

But all is not lost. Mother Nature decides it's time to make a change. And what better way to tell a tragic story about humans but through yet another podcast?</description>

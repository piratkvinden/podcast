  <title>Transforming Trauma</title>
  <description>In-depth conversations about how to help individuals and communities thrive after Complex Trauma. In a modern world beset by trauma and a legacy of suffering, conflict and disconnection, healing trauma can serve as a vehicle for personal and social transformation.

These leaders in the Trauma-Informed Care movement will guide listeners through the diverse ways they are supporting individuals, couples, families and communities in order to actualize Post-Traumatic Growth. Whether you are a healthcare professional, an educator, a parent, a public policy maker, a trauma survivor, or someone interested in personal healing and social justice; this podcast will provide you with a map for increased resiliency, greater health outcomes, healthier relationships, personal growth and social change through transforming trauma. Hosted by the Complex Trauma Training Center.</description>

   <title>Honoring Resistance: The Wisdom of Defenses in Somatic &amp; Hakomi-Informed Trauma Healing with Shai Lavie, LMFT</title>
   <description>Trauma isn't just an event—it’s a complex, living pattern woven through our bodies, minds, and relationships. What if the path to healing isn’t about breaking down defenses or pushing past resistance, but about honoring those very protections as parts of our whole self?

 

Shai Lavie’s journey illuminates this radical shift. As a Hakomi and Somatic Experiencing therapist, Shai learned that trauma work flourishes when we stop battling our clients’ “barriers” and instead bring curiosity and compassion to every part of their experience—even the parts that resist change. Imagine your nervous system not as a malfunctioning engine to be fixed, but as a profound intelligence signaling what it needs to survive and adapt.

 

In practice, this means holding space for a client’s “resistance”, listening deeply to these “barriers” with genuine inquiry: “What wisdom might be present here? What story is this body telling me?” Such an approach transforms therapy from a power struggle into a collaborative voyage, where client and therapist become co-captains rowing in harmony, not opposition.

 

This relational, respectful method aligns beautifully with the NeuroAffective Relational Model® (NARM®) principles—where healing happens in connection, at the client’s pace, and through mindful presence. It invites us all, as therapists and healers, to recalibrate our role: to cultivate safety not by conquering defenses, but by embracing them, fostering agency within the authentic self.

 

If you’re a mental health professional eager to deepen your understanding of complex trauma and transform your therapeutic practice, we invite you to explore the upcoming NARM Therapist Trainings at the Complex Trauma Training Center. Join a community committed to growing both professionally and personally—where we learn that healing is not about fighting against our adaptive Self, but reconnecting with the resilient, compassionate, authentic Self.</description>

   <title>Beyond Disorder: Redefining Identity, Meaning, and Healing with Dr. David Puder</title>
   <description>“The work we do is meaningful, sometimes difficult, but it's the best work to do.” - Dr. David Puder

On this episode of Transforming Trauma, Emily Ruth welcomes psychiatrist and psychotherapist Dr. David Puder to explore the clinical realities of complex trauma and the slow, often gritty path toward healing. Drawing on decades of hospital and outpatient experience, Dr. Puder offers candor and practical wisdom for clinicians and caring professionals who feel the weight of this work.

The pair discuss how complex developmental trauma shows up as dissociation and psychogenic symptoms rather than classic shock-based PTSD, how medical identities can eclipse a person’s strengths, and ways to help families shift out of illness-based roles. You’ll hear how dreams and creative writing can reveal disavowed material, why rare countertransference reactions are clinical clues, and how therapist reflective function — the ability to make meaning of inner reactions — predicts treatment impact. Dr. Puder also explains practical tools he developed, including a Connection Index for clinical teams, and offers concrete examples of converting medical patients into psychotherapy patients so they can reclaim agency and a life beyond diagnosis.

We invite you to listen to the full episode and follow Transforming Trauma on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or your favorite podcast app.

			<title>#001 Interview With A Man Who Sold LSD To Steve Jobs</title>
			<description>I don't usually interview people involved with the distribution side of psychedelics, but this conversation touches on so many fascinating topics in the history of LSD that I thought other people might find it interesting. The conversation covers Steve Jobs, Kary Mullis, ergotamine tartrate, LSD distribution, and SARS-CoV-2. </description>

			<description>A most superlative discussion of NMDA antagonists! MK-801 is the strongest dissociative that has been used by humans, it is also one of the most mysterious and (arguably) one of the most dangerous. Episode three of my podcast features an interview with a teenager who ordered MK-801 and tested it on himself and his friends. </description>

In this episode Jason Wallach and I discuss the strange origin of the head twitch response and how it became the most important behavioral correlate for 5HT2A agonism in non-human animals. </description>

			<title>#009 A Talk With Eric Andre (YouTube link in description)</title>
			<description>Hi, all. It turns out Eric Andre is a fan of the show and he called me yesterday to talk, here is our conversation.

In other news, we are gearing up to print a third and final edition of the pamphlet. The first edition was only 500 copies and contained a couple typos, the second edition is 2,500 copies and the third edition will be 5,000 copies. The pamphlet has already raised more than $70,000 for the Michael J Fox Foundation and more than $10,000 for the original toad artist Gail Patterson. As stipulated in the episode, I also plan to donate some money to toad conservation efforts via the Tucson Herpetological Society, but I'm waiting on them to propose a specific plan for the money before making the donation. Thanks everyone who bought a copy and for those that didn't I will be sure to post here first when the new edition is available.

I've recorded a couple of new Patreon-exclusive interviews that I'm currently editing, one about the chemistry of N-hydroxy-MDA and another that is a long discussion of the meth episode and disparaging article about the show by Erik Davis.  

I hope to have those out by the end of the week.

			<title>#010 Interview With A European PCE Chemist</title>
			<description>Hi, all. I've been receiving interesting messages from a variety of different chemists recently. Here is a discussion with a chemist who synthesized and tested an unusual arylcyclohexylamine called PCE

EDIT: I was interested in learning more about his technique for producing NaCN. I've attached an interesting article from 1895 that describes a similar process as well as a long Science Madness thread. Cyanide's reputation is deserved, it is seriously a deadly poison, a chemist friend killed himself with it last year. This is not some corny, "Don't try this at home!" boilerplate. Seriously––do not try this at home. </description>

			<description>Pascal Tanguay is a researcher who has lived in Thailand studying kratom for over a decade, our discussion covers the way the Thai media used kratom as a tool to justify increasing budgets for law enforcement and the traditions surrounding kratom use in Thailand. 

My friend (and former Pharmacopeia producer) Soren is still collecting information on kratom use in the United States. If you'd like to take the survey he created with Dr. Oliver Grundmann you can do so here: Tinyurl.com/Kratomteasurvey</description>

Lastly, at one point in this I say that ingestion of formic acid causes blindness. I assumed this was the case because formic acid is typically considered the toxic metabolite with methanol ingestion and many sources suggest it directly damages the optic nerve but I now wonder if that is truly the case. Case reports of high dose formic acid ingestion do not describe blindness so clearly there is some additional complexity in the matter. </description>

			<description>In this Q&amp;A I discuss smoking ketamine, LSD licenses, penile perception on trihexyphenidyl, injection necrosis from xylazine containing &quot;tranq dope&quot;, therapeutic validation for alien abductees, neuropixel probes, and more!

Small correction: I say only five FDA approved antidepressants are thought to exert their therapeutic effect via modulation of dopamine, but there are actually six if you include bupropion. I meant to say five *other than bupropion.* Also, the numbers reflect stats as of 2022, so the numbers might be slightly off after the approval of auvelity

			<title>#079 June Q&amp;A And An Update From The MAPS Conference</title>
			<description>Here is the newest patreon subscriber Q&amp;A, we discuss pharmahuasca, psychedelic disruption of thermoregulation, fork sodomy, regional variations in amphetamine synthesis, and more!
